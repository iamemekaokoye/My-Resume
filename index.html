        <h1>Objective Statement</h1>
        <p>Graduating top of my class as a computer science student, I knew i haven't completely been 
            equipped with the necessary skills for the job market. I took some other courses such as design 
            development, brand development, graphics design and recently user interface design. Then I decided 
            further take a Full-Stack Web development trainings and courses and this has opened me up to a 
            whole new journey and perspective in the internet and online global village. I look forward to 
            harnessing the skill and passion a a creative while connecting and working as a team-player with 
            other creatives.</p>
